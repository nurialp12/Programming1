# Gunbird by Coded Dreams
Coded Dreams is a team by five members that work on copying the GunBird arcade game, originally created by Psikyo. This project is the current first one of the university and consists to analyse every single detail and recreate it to the screen by using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). Up to now, we have already done the prototype (Castle level) and right now working on The Mine level, which will be our Alpha release.

#### Easter Egg
We have decided to put Megaman as an Easter Egg. Since the early stages of the development we used him as a base class for all the added enemies. Since we started to get used to it on screen we have decided to have it always as a part of our GunBird.
